<h1 align="center">Hoplite Stats Viewer</h1>

This is an **unofficial** player statistics website for the [Hoplite Minecraft Server](https://hoplite.gg/), as Hoplite does not maintain a statistics website or API at the moment. Features include:

- Individual player statistics pages.
- Leaderboards where players who excel in particular gamemodes on the server are displayed.
